Picup Truck
===========

A sample app that allows you to upload files. The app will read the file that was uploaded, delete the file from disk, and then show the file immediatly.

I was testing with PNG files, and there are no rules/validations right now. Will look into thsi later; just wanted to save the progress I have already.
